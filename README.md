# flcl-marketplace-sellers
FLCL-Marketplace-Sellers is a marketplace created by sellers to address common issues in the seller experience. 
various platforms—including eBay, Shopify, Amazon, Walmart, Target, 
international markets, StockX, Depop, Grailed, and more—the platform is built by sellers for sellers.

Many existing selling platforms were developed by individuals without hands-on experience in selling a diverse range of products 
and services. In response, FLCL is dedicated to providing a marketplace that is truly backed by experienced sellers who understand the game/industry.
